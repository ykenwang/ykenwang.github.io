# baseurl will often be '', but for a project page on gh-pages, it needs to
# be the project name.
# *** IMPORTANT: If your local "jekyll serve" throws errors change this to '' or
#     run it like so: jekyll serve --baseurl=''
# baseurl: /jekyll-clean
baseurl: ''

# The 'comments' setting enables comments. You'll need to select either
# disqus or isso below to choose a comment system. Individual posts can
# override 'comments' to disable on a post-by-post basis.
